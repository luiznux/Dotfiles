## Install

### Clone my repository

```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/luiznux/dotfiles
```

### Execute the script

sudo privileges to work, so keep an eye out when prompted for your
password.

Make it executable and run it.

After the end of the execute the script, a install.log file will be
created as a log file to see eventual errors.
